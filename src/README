To install cstk, you'll want to run the "setup" script in this
directory.  For this to function properly, you'll either need
write access to the target directory (default is /opt/cstk),
or you'll need sudo (or some other method of running setup as
root) so you can write to the target location.

Things you'll need:
	- An ANSI C compiler in your $PATH, preferrable called
	  cc.  If you need to point to a customer compiler, the
	  environment variable COMPILER can be defined and we
	  use that.
	- A system that is either some type of Linux, NetBSD or
	  Mac OS from 10.0 onwards.  Other variants will likely
	  work (AIX, HP/UX and Solaris for example), but the
	  original work is tested on Linux, NetBSD and Mac OS.
	- A few megabytes of disk space for where you are going
	  to install to, and a few more for where you are doing
	  the compilation.

Binary distributions exist for some Linux variants, NetBSD and
Mac OS.
