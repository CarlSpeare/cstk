There are a few scripts here that are still marginally useful today.

The capture_vital_info and ecfg pairing:
 - capture_vital_info: this copies useful information into /etc/backup (by default).
 - ecfg: this grabs useful information from remote systems and copies it locally.
These are meant to be used in tandem to make system recovery easier.  The information
that capture_vital_info shoves into /etc/backup can resurrect a lot of what a system
looked like; paired with what ecfg will normally grab (assuming you use the config
noted in the comments) means you can recover the basic personality of a system - BUT
NOT THE DATA.  Grabbing /etc/ gives you a lot; grabbing /etc/, crontabs and the info
in /boot gives you a huge amount.  Assuming that you have user data elsewhere, the
info provided by capture_vital_info will tell you what software was installed via
dpkg/rpm so you can re-install applications, what services were running, what mounts
were active, networking information, etc.

encrypt/decrypt use OpenSSL to make a command-line encryption/decryption pairing for
local use.  The intent here is that we encrypt everything sensitive when not in use,
backup the system, and then decrypt as necessary.

The less useful tools:
 - iso8601: 'date -Iseconds' should do the same thing.
 - epoch2date: modern date can also convert epoch to human-readable times.
 - shmtest.c: we all miss Chuck, and it's pretty rare that we need this to test shared
   memory, but sometimes it does come in handy.
